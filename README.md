# Expense Tracker

This react app was built by following https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code O'Reilly video courses.

Some details are not covered in the course, like the js new Date() function bug, where when you pass 2023-01-23 to its constructor, you get a new date from 2023-01-22, but if you pass 2023/01/23 you get the correct date.
